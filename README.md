# Weather_Modeling

##Project Motivation:
To model malaria, you need good data on rainfall and temperature as mosquitoes
breed in standing water and temperature influences the rate at which the
parasite matures. However, there are very few ground based weather stations
in the equatorial African nations which suffer the greatest malaria burden.
The goal of this project is address this issue by using machine learning to
extrapolate between weather stations separated by unusually long distances.

##Status:
This project is on hold until NOAA fixes the Global Summary of the Day (GSOD)
dataset. It is currently missing nearly all of the data listed in the data
inventory for the regions of interest. NOAA has been notified of the issue.
